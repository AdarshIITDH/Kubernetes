# Kubernetes
There are multiple ways to set up a Kubernetes cluster on-premise or on a Virtual Machine in the cloud-like EC2.

Remember, Kubernetes doesn't come pre-equipped with container runtimes or networking components by default. Configuration of Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and Container Network Interface (CNI) is necessary. This step ensures seamless containerization and networking within your Kubernetes cluster.
